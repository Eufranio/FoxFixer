# FoxFixer
FoxFixer is a client-side forge mod used in the MagiTech Network modpacks to patch some client-side issues by using [Mixins](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) to change the code of mods at runtime and patch the bugs.

## Issues patched:
* Yggdrasil exception console spam (not usable atm)
* ExNihilo barrel render crash
* Invalid slot click crash on certain containers
* Ars Magica 2 illusion block render crash
* Thermal Foundation facade render crash
* Thaumcraft sync issue when changing bungee servers. Disabled, untested.

## This mod was made for Minecraft 1.7.10, and the jar names must be the same as the ones in the mixins config.
